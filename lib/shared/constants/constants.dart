LACRIMA
HISTORY
Established in 1959, LACRIMA is one of the most experienced dairy producers in Bulgaria, producing high-quality traditional Bulgarian white brine cheese and yellow cheese.
 
LACRIMA'S plant is one of the oldest in Bulgaria. With an area of 3,000 m², it is one of the largest dairies in the country in terms of production capacity. The plant is located in the town of Pazardzhik, South Bulgaria, near the Rhodope Mountains. The region is famous for its fertile soils, green pastures, cattle breeding, and cheese production.
 
Our cheese is handmade by experienced cheesecake's according to a traditional Bulgarian recipe, using only the highest quality Bulgarian milk and carefully selected ferments.
 
To achieve the highest possible quality, LACRIMA tests every batch of milk and every ferment purchased. Throughout the production process, each product undergoes more than 30 quality tests.
 
LACRIMA's cheese products won two gold medals at the International Food Fair "The World of Milk" in Sofia in 2014.
 
 
RAW MILK SUPPLY
At LACRIMA we make our products only from natural raw milk from Bulgaria. The largest livestock farms in South Bulgaria supply us daily with cow's milk and seasonally with sheep's milk.
 
Since LACRIMA's inception, we have provided resources and expertise to local livestock farms to ensure the purity, consistent quality and high nutritional value of the raw milk.
 
The daily processing capacity is approximately 70 tonnes of raw milk.
 
QUALITY CONTROL
LACRIMA has its own laboratory with modern equipment for the analysis of raw milk, product analysis at the various stages of the production process and quality control of the final products.
 
A team of specialists monitors the technological performance at each stage of production.
 
Product samples are tested during coagulation, cutting and ripening. The storage process is monitored on a daily basis.
 
An external laboratory is involved in quality control at regular intervals to ensure the objectivity of the results.
PRODUCTION
Unlike many other companies producing white brine cheese in Bulgaria, we do not compromise on any of the production steps. We produce according to the authentic traditional methods and insist on the highest possible quality.
Bulgarian white brine cheese and yellow cheese (Kashkaval) can be produced in different ways, which affects the final price.
We pride ourselves on the high quality and consistent taste of our products, which are 100% natural in origin and have a great taste.
We care deeply about our consumers and therefore reject any practices that lower the price but ultimately affect the quality of our products.

EXPORT
LACRIMA is a licensed exporter of Bulgarian white brine cheese and yellow cheese. Outside Bulgaria, our products are also very well received by consumers in Europe, Russia and Middle East. With our new factory in Jordan, we have expanded our product range.
 
We can supply our products in bulk and branded consumer packaging, both in our standard formats and in formats specifically produced to suit our client’s needs.
 
CERTIFICATES
 
LACRIMA has accreditation International Food Standard (IFS) - the highest international production standard for quality and hygiene. Our products are also Halal certified
